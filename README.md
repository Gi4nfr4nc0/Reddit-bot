## Self-hosted

Reddit-Discord-Bot is now super easy to self-host. You can either use the docker image or build a binary yourself.

Before you can run the bot you need to create a config file. You can find an example [here](/config.example.yml)

You also need a discord bot token, which you can get from [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

Lastly you need to create a reddit app which can be done [here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/).

The bot requires a database, which can either be `SQLite` or `PostgreSQL`. Just select the one you want to use in the config file.

### Binary

Prerequisites:

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (optional)

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:topi314/Reddit-Discord-Bot.git
$ cd Reddit-Discord-Bot
$ go build -o reddit-discord-bot .
```

You can now run the bot with

```bash
$ ./reddit-discord-bot -config config.yml
```

### Docker-Compose

```bash
version: "3.8"

services:
  reddit-bot:
    image: ghcr.io/topi314/reddit-discord-bot:master
    container_name: reddit-bot
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
	  - ./config.yml:/var/lib/reddit-discord-bot/config.yml
	  - ./database.db:/var/lib/reddit-discord-bot/database.db
```
