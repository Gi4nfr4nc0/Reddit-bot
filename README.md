Simple webhook based bot delivering Reddit posts into your Discord Server

## Public Bot

## Self-hosted

Reddit-Discord-Bot is now super easy to self-host. You can either use the docker image or build a binary yourself.

Before you can run the bot you need to create a config file. You can find an example [here](/config.example.yml)

You also need a discord bot token, which you can get from [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

Lastly you need to create a reddit app which can be done [here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/).

The bot requires a database, which can either be `SQLite` or `PostgreSQL`. Just select the one you want to use in the config file.

### Binary

Prerequisites:

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (optional)

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:topi314/Reddit-Discord-Bot.git
$ cd Reddit-Discord-Bot
$ go build -o reddit-discord-bot .
```

You can now run the bot with

```bash
$ ./reddit-discord-bot -config config.yml
```

### Docker-Compose

Docker-Compose is the easiest way to run the bot and is also the way I recommend.

#### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (optional)

#### Setup

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file and paste the following into it

```bash
version: "3.8"

services:
  reddit-bot:
    image: ghcr.io/topi314/reddit-discord-bot:master
    container_name: reddit-bot
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./config.yml:/var/lib/reddit-discord-bot/config.yml
      - ./database.db:/var/lib/reddit-discord-bot/database.db
```

#### Configuration

Create a `config.yml` file and paste [this](/config.example.yml) into it.

Fill in the required fields, and you are good to go!

Also create a `database.db` file if you want to use SQLite.

#### Running

You can now run the bot with

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

#### Updating

To update the bot just run

```bash
$ docker-compose pull
$ docker-compose up -d
```

#### Stopping

To stop the bot run

```bash
$ docker-compose down
```
